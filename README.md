# HTML Assignment:  One Topic - Two Web Pages

You will create two web pages about a chosen topic. Be careful that you don't get too distracted by your 'topic' that you forget to finish project this on time.


The project is expected to follow good coding practices as we discussed in class and follow HTML 5 coding structure. You may pick a topic of your choice and use headers to organize your content into sections.

Note: You are able to use filler or generated text for paragraphs ([https://www.lipsum.com/feed/html](https://www.lipsum.com/feed/html))

## index.html   Page 1 
* Website title using a h1 header. 
* **Image** that when clicked takes you to another website. _Text_ should appear if the image does not load and the browser will open a _new_tab_ or window when clicked.

* Insert a Youtube video here that relates to your topic.
  
* A list (ordered or unordered).  A minimum of three items must be included on the list.

    1. One item is a link that will bring you to a second webpage that you have created.
    2. A second item of the list is a link to a related website.
    3. The final item on the list is a **mailto** link.	

* A section will include two paragraphs (generated text is ok).  There will be a _line_ _break_ between the paragraphs.  In the first paragraph you must use **two** of the following, bolded, italicized, marked, deleted, inserted, subscripted or superscripted text.


## second.html    Page 2
This second webpage will have generated **text** and some **images** related to your topic.  Seperate each section with an appropriate **header**. There must be enough so that you can use *three* anchors to move between the sections of the page.  At the end of each section the user can click on an anchor to return to the *top* of the second page.  Finally, the user can click to return to the first web page.
